## 👦 Introduction
Hey, I am Sagar. My area of knowledge includes statistical analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. My primary goal is to use my analytical skills to turn raw data into meaningful insights that can be used to make informed business decisions. I am proficient in Python and Tableau, which allows me to build data models and create visualizations. Through my passion for learning and my ability to work collaboratively in a team, I am excited to take on new challenges and make impactful contributions in the field of data science.
